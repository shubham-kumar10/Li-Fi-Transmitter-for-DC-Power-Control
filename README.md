# AC/DC Power Control using Li-Fi

This project aims to is to develop an embedded system for controlling home appliances(using power control) via smartphones and Visible Light Communication (VLC). Our design uses VLC to counter the problem of congestion in the RF spectrum and establish indoor communication between devices.

### Built Using:
